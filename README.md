# Job-Manager
amalgamate all data from your job sites like Reed, Indeed, Glassdoor etc. into one handy dashboard

This version currently only works for Reed.

Enter your credentials into the credentials dictionary and upon executing the script a xlsx worksheet will be created where you can manage 
all your job applications and other information in one dashboard.

How you view the information and create dashboards is up to you, but the worksheet creation and website requests is handled entirely
by the program.
